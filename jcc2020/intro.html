					<h2 id="about">About</h2>
					<p>
						Why are we proposing a new international conference on the theme of JointCloud? The reasons are as follows:
					</p>
					<li>
						<span></span>
						<p>
					       		Cloud service providers currently exist independently in the cloud computing ecosystem, but this independence has resulted in many pain points - such as the decline of marginal benefit in single cloud service providers, and platform lock-in for cloud service users. These problems seriously restrict the healthy development of cloud industry; it is therefore imperative for new research to be performed into the abiltiy to join and work between multiple clouds.

							JointCloud computing (also referred to Hybrid-Cloud, Inter-Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Federation, Cross-Cloud and Cloud Service Broker etc.) supports bilateral or multilateral collaboration among various cloud participants (such as providers, consumers, agents, regulators, etc.) at different levels of traditional cloud (such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS, etc.) in a mutually beneficial manner to meet the major challenges facing the development of cloud computing.	
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span></span>
						<p>
							At present, international conferences relating to cloud computing mainly focus on intra-cloud or single cloud systems - there are few events that focus on inter-cloud or multiple clouds, and there is an urgent need to provide an international conferences to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice for JointCloud systems for both researchers and industry practitioners.
						</p>
					</li>
													
					<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
					<p>
						Cloud computing holds the promise of “computing as a utility”, where
						users can access services from everywhere in a “pay-as-you-go” fashion.
						Enabled by cloud computing, developers are no longer required to
						purchase and maintain hardware to deploy their software and services,
						which has rapidly changed the IT industry and shaped the way how
						software is designed and delivered. The first-generation cloud (referred
						to as Cloud 1.0) mainly focuses on aggregating
						large-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed,
						auto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of
						computing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
						Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have
						achieved remarkable.  However, there has recently been new challenges
						emerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely
						redefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is
						required between individual clouds due to service combination and
						location-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are
						experiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like “November
						11” and “Black Friday” usually require over 10x more resources than
						daily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud
						provider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications
						have brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and
						provider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the
						performance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the
						services is highly urged.
					</p>
					<p>
						To address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to
						consider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds
						(referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud
						2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud
						computing. For example, the concept
						of SuperCloud has been coined to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Intercloud Fabric has been advocated by Cisco to enable transparent communication
						across clouds. <strong>Internet-based virtual
						computing environment (iVCE)</strong> has been proposed to provide harmonious, trustworthy and
						transparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across
						multiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored
						the economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the
						cost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>JointCloud Computing</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The international conference on Joint Cloud Computing aims to provision an effective pathway for researchers and practitioners to share and discuss the state of the arts and new ideas in terms of joint cloud computing (aka. JointCloud). JointCloud is a new generation of computing model beyond Cloud 2.0 which facilitates developers to customize cross-cloud services through software-defined integration and cooperation among different cloud service entities. The main objective of the workshop is to: 1) investigate theories and mechanisms of cross-cloud resource abstraction, representation, and aggregation; 2) design and implement platform-level solutions and infrastructures (computation, storage and networking) to underpin the joint cloud execution environments; 3) explore innovative applications that leverage emerging techniques such as deep learning and block chain to provision intelligent and reliable JointCloud services. Compared against previous efforts in Cloud 2.0, the philosophy of JointCloud not only focuses on the vertical orchestration of cloud resources but reinforces horizontal cooperation among cloud vendors in the form of service-oriented computing paradigm.
