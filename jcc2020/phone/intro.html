					Why are we proposing a new international conference on the theme of JointCloud? The reasons are as follows:
				</li>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					At present, international conferences related to cloud mainly focus on intra-cloud or single cloud, and few workshops focus on inter-cloud or multipls clouds. JointCloud computing (also referred to Hybrid-Cloud, Inter-Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Federation, Cross-Cloud and Cloud Service Broker (CSB) etc.) has become a new research object, and there is an urgent need to provide international conferences to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of cloud computing for both researchers and industry practitioners. The independence of cloud service providers in the cloud computing ecosystem exists naturally, but the resulting pain points such as the decline of marginal benefit of single cloud service providers and the platform lock-in of cloud service users have seriously restricted the healthy development of cloud industry. In order to solve the bottleneck problem in the new development period of cloud computing, JointCloud computing as a prospective research object came into being. JointCloud computing supports bilateral or multilateral collaboration among various cloud participants (such as providers, consumers, agents, regulators, etc.) at different levels of traditional cloud (such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS, etc.) in a mutually beneficial manner to meet the major challenges facing the development of cloud computing.²  At present, there are several related international conference, such as IEEE Cloud (first coined in 2009), IEEE CloudCom (first coined in 2009), IEEE CCEM (first coined in 2012), IEEE CloudNet (first coined in 2012), CBD (first coined in 2013) and IEEE/ACM UCC (first coined in 2009) etc.  Most of these conferences focused on IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, cloud applications, cloud management etc., which belongs to the technique topics of intra-cloud or single cloud.
				</li>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					There have been workshops/symposiums related to inter-cloud or multiple clouds internationally, such as “CrossCloud (first coined in 2013)”, “ICI (first coined in 2013)”, “CSB (first coined in 2012)”, “IEEE JCC (first coined in 2009)” etc. Most of these workshops/symposiums focused on technique topics of inter-cloud or multiple clouds. Our past experience in holding IEEE JCC workshop, as well as the accumulation of research work around the JointCloud, make us well equipped to hold IEEE JCC international conference. We started IEEE JCC workshop which focuses on technique topics of inter-cloud or multiple clouds 10 years ago, prior to the existing workshops/symposiums such as CrossCloud, ICI and CSB.  
				</li>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					We have been funded by “National Key R&D Program of China” and “ the National Natural Science Foundation of China” for more than 10 years on such technique topics of inter-cloud or multiple clouds. And we have formed a tightly coupled international research community which has the advantage to make IEEE JCC be an international conference with extensive and international characteristics.

			<ul>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					Cloud computing holds the promise of “computing as a utility”, where users can access services from everywhere in a “pay-as-you-go” fashion. Enabled by cloud computing, developers are no longer required to purchase and maintain hardware to deploy their software and services, which has rapidly changed the IT industry and shaped the way how software is designed and delivered. The first-generation cloud (referred to as Cloud 1.0 in this proposal) mainly focuses on aggregating large-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed, auto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of computing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have achieved remarkable. However, there has recently been new challenges emerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely redefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is required between individual clouds due to service combination and location-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are experiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like “November 11” and “Black Friday” usually require over 10x more resources than daily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud provider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications have brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and provider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the performance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the services is highly urged.
				</li>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					To address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to consider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds (referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud 2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud computing. For example, researchers from Europe have coined the concept of SuperCloud to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Cisco advocates their Intercloud Fabric to enable transparent communication across clouds. Chinese researchers have proposed Internet-based virtual computing environment (iVCE) to provide harmonious, trustworthy and transparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across multiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored the economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the cost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services.

					JointCloud Computing
				</li>
				<li class="h5-content-liinfo indent">
					The international conference on Joint Cloud Computing aims to provision an effective pathway for researchers and practitioners to share and discuss the state of the arts and new ideas in terms of joint cloud computing (aka. JointCloud). JointCloud is a new generation of computing model beyond Cloud 2.0 which facilitates developers to customize cross-cloud services through software-defined integration and cooperation among different cloud service entities. The main objective of the workshop is to: 1) investigate theories and mechanisms of cross-cloud resource abstraction, representation, and aggregation; 2) design and implement platform-level solutions and infrastructures (computation, storage and networking) to underpin the joint cloud execution environments; 3) explore innovative applications that leverage emerging techniques such as deep learning and block chain to provision intelligent and reliable JointCloud services. Compared against previous efforts in Cloud 2.0, the philosophy of JointCloud not only focuses on the vertical orchestration of cloud resources but reinforces horizontal cooperation among cloud vendors in the form of service-oriented computing paradigm.
