						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">IEEE JCC 2020 Will Move to Online</strong>
						<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear authors and participants of IEEE JCC 2020,
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; IEEE JCC 2020 and the co-located conferences will be held online. The exact online way of the conference will be announced very soon. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; It is approved by IEEE that the conference will become online only. This means no physical attendance to the conference. It is due to the Covid-19 pandemic that international travel and large scale gathering is still not feasible. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; Accommodation booking can be refunded after deduction of 10% fees that the conferences have already paid to third parties for bank transactions and  online registration fees. Directions on how to make a request of refund will follow shortly. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; We are still working with IEEE to set a new budget for the online events. It is expected to adjust the authors registration fees as well as non-authors registration fees. Once the budget is approved, refunding of a part of the paid registration fees will take place. Please be patient with us. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; The conference technical programmes will be rescheduled to fit with the online event requirements, especially to take into considerations of timezone differences of the participants. In order for a paper to be included in the IEEE’s digital library, the authors will be required to upload their recorded presentations as well as to attend online sessions remotely through an online conferencing facility, like Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Details will follow. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; The conference proceedings will be available for preview before the conference. It is planned to be online for conference participants to view and download from 8th July 2020. 
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Wishes，
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; The organizing committee of IEEE JCC 2020

						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Notification of New dates of IEEE JCC 2020</strong>
						<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have the new dates of the conference IEEE JCC 2020. It is from the 3rd to 6th August, 2020. The venue is the same, i.e. Keble College. 
					    <br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; Accommodation bookings do NOT need to be cancelled, as the local chair Prof. Hong will provide a facility to convert it to the new dates soon.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to prepare to apply for visa again, A new invitation letter can be asked from Prof. Hong (hzhu@brookes.ac.uk).

					<p class="news-info" style="text-indent:0;">
						<strong style="font-weight: bold;">Notification of postponement of IEEE JCC 2020</strong>
						<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear authors and participants of IEEE JCC 2020,
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; IEEE JCC 2020 and the co-located conferences will be postponed to summer 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The exact new date of the conference will be announced very soon. Making this decision has not been easy. This decision was made by the joint steering committee of the co-located conferences after numerous discussions and telephone calls, several rounds of consultations with IEEE's Event Organisation Team, and renegotiations with the venue host. We have taken into consideration the current state and predictions officially announced by the UK government and many other countries. We have carefully compared various options, such as running the conferences online, completely canceling the conferences, and running it as it was scheduled plus online presentations for those who cannot attend, etc., assessed the impacts on both the academic and scientific quality of our event, the health and well-beings of conference delegates, as well as the financial viability. We believe that this is the most responsible reaction to the current situation of Covid-19 outbreak. We hope you will support this decision and all work together to make the conferences a success despite of the difficulty we are facing.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone planning to attend the conference needs a refund, all refund requests must be made on the registration website. This is the refund policy for the registration fees and accommodation bookings:
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ● &nbsp;  Authors’ registrations cannot be refunded. Authors who still cannot attend the conference in person at the postponed dates due to good reasons will be allowed to present their work online remotely.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ● &nbsp;  Non-author registrations can be refunded upon request, but will have to be deducted by 10% of the registration fees to cover the cost of bank transactions and online registration facility usage fees.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ● &nbsp;  Accommodation bookings can be refunded upon request, but also have to be deducted by 10% of the booking price to cover the cost of bank transactions and online registration facility usage fees.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ● &nbsp;  For non-author registrations and accommodation bookings, please consider to delay your refund request until you finally decide not to attend, because if you make a future registration for the postponed event or accommodation booking after the refund, it will be treated as a new booking by the registration tool.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; We are committed to run the conference successfully.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Wishes，
						<br />

								JointCloud Computing (JCC) is a new cloud computing paradigm - it is also referred to as Hybrid-Cloud, Inter-Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Federation, Supercloud, Cross-Cloud and Cloud Service Broker) etc. JointCloud computing supports bilateral or multilateral collaboration among various cloud participants (such as providers, consumers, agents, regulators, etc.) at different levels of traditional cloud (such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS, etc.) in a mutually beneficial manner to meet the major challenges facing the development of cloud computing.
