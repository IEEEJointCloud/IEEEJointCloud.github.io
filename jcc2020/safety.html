			&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear authors and participants of IEEE JCC 2020, here is the decision on the format of the online conferences.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; IEEE JCC 2020 and the co-located conferences will be held online. Here is the decision on the format of the online conferences. 
			</p>
						
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; The online conferences will have 3 days with longer day schedules. The global time table for all co-located conferences is attached to this email for you to revise the sessions. Please consider to assign papers to a session that is convenient for the authors and especially to avoid awkward time zones.
			</p>
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; All paper presentations must be recorded in advance and available to watch at the conference. It is suggested that at the paper presentation sessions, a short summary is presented by the author followed by questions and answers. If for any reason this cannot be done, for example, when the network connection is not stable, or there is too few participants in the session, or the author cannot give a short summary, the recorded presentation can be play instead.
			</p>
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; Plenary sessions (include all keynote speeches, opening and closing sessions and plenary panels) will be live. Keynotes need be have pre-recorded presentation in advance as a backup for technical problems. Please also inform keynote speakers to prepare a video recording of their keynote speech.
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ● &nbsp; We will use Zoom for sessions plus Slack for communications between participants. Additional Zoom rooms will be available for informal meet-ups. We will also have an internal website for registered users to access recorded videos, links to proceedings, Zoom rooms, etc. We plan to use Moodle (to be confirmed) for this purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Other unmentioned matters will be determined gradually in the near future and we will inform you as soon as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Wishes，
			<p>
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; The organizing committee of IEEE JCC 2020
			</p>
