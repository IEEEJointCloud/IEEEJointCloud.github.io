				It is approved by IEEE that the conference will become online only. This means no physical attendance to the conference. It is due to the Covid-19 pandemic that international travel and large scale gathering is still not feasible. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Accommodation booking can be refunded after deduction of 10% fees that the conferences have already paid to third parties for bank transactions and  online registration fees. Directions on how to make a request of refund will follow shortly.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are still working with IEEE to set a new budget for the online events. It is expected to adjust the authors registration fees as well as non-authors registration fees. Once the budget is approved, refunding of a part of the paid registration fees will take place. Please be patient with us. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The conference technical programmes will be rescheduled to fit with the online event requirements, especially to take into considerations of timezone differences of the participants. In order for a paper to be included in the IEEEâ€™s digital library, the authors will be required to upload their recorded presentations as well as to attend online sessions remotely through an online conferencing facility, like Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Details will follow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The conference proceedings will be available for preview before the conference. It is planned to be online for conference participants to view and download from 8th July 2020.
