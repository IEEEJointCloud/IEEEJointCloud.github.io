				Dear authors and participants of IEEE JCC 2020,
			</p>
			<p>
				IEEE JCC 2020 and the co-located conferences will be postponed to summer 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The exact new date of the conference will be announced very soon. Making this decision has not been easy. This decision was made by the joint steering committee of the co-located conferences after numerous discussions and telephone calls, several rounds of consultations with IEEE's Event Organisation Team, and renegotiations with the venue host. We have taken into consideration the current state and predictions officially announced by the UK government and many other countries. We have carefully compared various options, such as running the conferences online, completely canceling the conferences, and running it as it was scheduled plus online presentations for those who cannot attend, etc., assessed the impacts on both the academic and scientific quality of our event, the health and well-beings of conference delegates, as well as the financial viability. We believe that this is the most responsible reaction to the current situation of Covid-19 outbreak. We hope you will support this decision and all work together to make the conferences a success despite of the difficulty we are facing.
			</p>
			<p>
				If anyone planning to attend the conference needs a refund, all refund requests must be made on the registration website. This is the refund policy for the registration fees and accommodation bookings:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>•</span>  Authors’ registrations cannot be refunded. Authors who still cannot attend the conference in person at the postponed dates due to good reasons will be allowed to present their work online remotely. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>•</span>  Non-author registrations can be refunded upon request, but will have to be deducted by 10% of the registration fees to cover the cost of bank transactions and online registration facility usage fees.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>•</span>  Accommodation bookings can be refunded upon request, but also have to be deducted by 10% of the booking price to cover the cost of bank transactions and online registration facility usage fees.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>•</span>  For non-author registrations and accommodation bookings, please consider to delay your refund request until you finally decide not to attend, because if you make a future registration for the postponed event or accommodation booking after the refund, it will be treated as a new booking by the registration tool. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are committed to run the conference successfully.</p>
			<p>Best Wishes，</p>
			<p>The organizing committee of IEEE JCC 2020</p>
			<p>March 11, 2020</p>
